# Emotion-Detection
This project focuses on recognizing facial expressions using the CK+ (Cohn-Kanade) dataset. It involves data exploration, face detection, image preprocessing, and preparation for deep learning models.

# Features

- **Dataset Exploration** : Listing emotion classes and counting images per class.

- **Face Detection** : Using OpenCVâ€™s Haar Cascade classifier to extract facial regions.

- **Image Preprocessing** :Resizing images to 224x224 and normalizing pixel values.

## Dataset

The CK+ dataset contains labeled facial expressions categorized into the following classes:

- Anger

- Contempt

- Disgust

- Fear

- Happiness

- Sadness

- Surprise
